    <p>I know, I know. Who needs a recipe for grilled cheese? It’s not necessarily about a long list of fancy ingredients and 
        over-the-top fillings. Today, I have a really easy technique that I’ve been using since I can remember to make the BEST 
        grilled cheese sandwiches.</p>
        <p>Whenever I make one of these sandwiches for someone, they always want seconds. These little changes in the way you 
            cook up this iconic recipe will make a huge difference in the end result. So, stay with me here! Give my method a 
            try and let me know what you think.</p>
            <br>
 <h3>Ingredients You Will Need:</h3>
 <ul>
    <li><strong>Bread- </strong> You can use any type you like – white, whole wheat, sourdough, or even a gluten-free variety 
        for those with dietary restrictions.</li>
    <li><strong>Mayonnaise- </strong>Any type you like best. You can even try out this homemade version!</li>
    <li><strong>Cheese- </strong>It brings the gooey, melty goodness that’s essential in a grilled cheese. Feel free to experiment with 
        other cheeses like mozzarella for stretchiness, Swiss for a nutty flavor, or a dairy-free cheese if you’re vegan.</li>
 </ul>
 <br>
 <h3>Steps:</h3>
 <ol>
    <li><strong>Spread the Mayonnaise</strong> First things first, grab your bread slices and slather them with mayonnaise. Go 
        generous with it, but no need to overdo it.</li>
        <br>
    <li><strong>Time For Cheese </strong>Now, heat up your skillet over medium heat. Take one of those mayo-coated slices and 
        place it mayo side down in the skillet. Then comes the fun part – sprinkle on that cheese. Half a cup should do the 
        trick. And hey, it’s okay if some cheese strays onto the pan.</li>
        <br>
    <li><Strong> Grill to Perfection</Strong> Grab your second slice of bread, mayo side up this time, and gently lay it on top 
        of the cheese. Let your sandwich cook for about 4-5 minutes. Keep an eye on it – we’re aiming for golden brown, not
         charred black. If your skillet is too hot, don’t hesitate to dial it back a bit.</li>
         <br>
    <li>
        <strong>The Flip</strong>Once the bottom is perfectly golden, it’s time to turn it over. Give the other side about 3-4 
        minutes to get that same delicious, golden color. This is where the cheese gets all melty and irresistible. Your grilled
         cheese is ready!
    </li>
 </ol>
